# Off-by-one Error in Dart For Loop
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating over a list using a for loop.  The error arises from incorrectly using the length of the list in the loop condition.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code. The correct solution is provided in `bugSolution.dart`.

This example highlights the importance of careful index management when working with lists and arrays in programming.
